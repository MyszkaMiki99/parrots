# parrots
*Parrots is a short project where I manipulate the quality of the image by using clustering, in this instance kmeans clustering was used.
"parrots" is an inbuild image from a package therefore no additional code or change to directory need to be done in order to run the code.
 Naturally with small tweeks the code can be run on any image.*
